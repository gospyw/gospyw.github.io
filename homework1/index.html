            <p>Welcome to my bio! Hello, my name is Gospel and I am excited to share a lil info about myself. I am 24 years old and I recently came to the realisation that I need to have a more "screw it" attitude and just go for things I have interests in. Hence, I took a massive leap of faith and dove head first into this boot camp course. I say head first because I don't have prior coding experience like most others participating in the course but I accept this major challenge and find it quite exciting.</p>

            <br>
            <p>My current job is working for a valet company downtown Minneapolis. It is a pretty sweet gig (except during the winter months where I can't feel my fingers or toes) and I have driven some very amazing (and super expensive) cars, my favourite being a Lamborghini Aventador. I have gotten to interact with hundreds if not thousands of people over the years and built relationships I hold quite dear to me. However, that job doesn't have longevity and I would much rather pursue my dreams of becoming a programmer.</p>  
            <br>
            <p>What am I looking to gain from this course? My main goal is to breach the cyber security world and become a hacker. A good hacker! Don't panic. I want to test security systems for businesses and create unbreachable defenses. So I am hoping that this course will first teach me about the coding world and how to implement various codes and styles. Next, I want to get a new job this summer working for a company and being part of teams and projects where I can contribute to bringing ideas to life. Once my foot is in the door I know the world of possibilities is boundless and this is what drives me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My hobbies are actually pretty diverse. I am a nerd at heart and like to game and spend unhealthy amounts of time at my PC because I built her myself and she is my baby. My other baby is my motorbike and, when the weather isn't depressingly dull, I take her out for rides as often as I can. I enjoy listening to audio books, trying new restaurants and acquiring knowledge in random subjects. Did you know, just like fingerprints, everybody has unique tongue prints? Fascinating.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for reading my bio! Feel free to reach out to me by navigating to the "Contacts" tab at the top of the page. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
