    <p>My name is Gospel. I am 24 years old (I feel much much older though) and I took this class because I have always been interested in computing and pursuing a career in this field but was intimidated by the idea of spending 4 years pursuing a degree. My hobbies include sleeping, like a lot, gaming, anime and motorbikes. I hope to gain a lot of knowledge and develop a vast array of skills from this boot camp that I can use to take me to the next level in my life.</p>
